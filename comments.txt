problem: we need to get rid of the darkness for the rotation, how?
solution: after backwards rotation we need to detect the pure black parts in edges. trim function to the rescue!!!
    problem of trim: we cannot get height x width in pixels, how can we compare distances later?
                        eliminate the 'same shape' requirement!
                        maybe we should compare distances but when we are closer to edges of
                        our image, we can use smaller we can ignore them

                     or better, we can calculate according to smaller value ex: 4040 x 3016 vs 4032 x 3024 -> get abs(width1 - width2) and abs(height1 - height2) 8
                                                                                dont care about first and lat 4 pixels :) will it work?
